## Covid Policy 2022

To make sure that Prewired remains a safe place for everyone, we ask that you follow our Covid Policy.

* Be respectful of other people and stay socially distanced whenever possible.
* We donâ€™t require proof of a negative test result, however we strongly encourage all attendees to test regularly, especially before each session.
* If you have coronavirus, experience any symptoms, or are feeling unwell, please stay at home.
* Attendees come from all over the city, bringing together people who might not otherwise be mixing. Please be mindful of this when attending, and respect our Covid Policy throughout the whole session.

As always, you must reserve your place at each session in advance. 
This can be done for free as described on our [How To Attend Page](/registration/). 
Do not turn up on the day without a reserved place, as you will be unable to attend.

*Looking to book tickets for the FIRST LEGO League Taster Session on 4 September? [Go here!](https://www.tickettailor.com/events/prewired/1351805)*

If you would like to attend Prewired, please:

1. Book a spot [on TicketTailor](https://buytickets.at/prewired/1223517). You can attend as often as you'd like! New dates are added at the end of each month.
2. [Subscribe](https://eepurl.com/dv2dPb) to our mailing list to keep up to date with notices and events.
3. Turn up!
    * Check yourself in at the registration desk
    * If you have never coded before, or have but don't know what to do, no problem! Introduce yourself to a mentor (they'll be wearing lanyards) when you arrive, and they'll help you to get started.
    * If you're already working on a coding project (maybe you're building your own website), or learning a topic by yourself and are happy to carry on with that, cool beans. Make yourself at home and ask any of our volunteers if you need help, or you can put your hand up and someone will spot you!

If you can't make a session anymore, please cancel your booking so your spot can be given to someone else.
